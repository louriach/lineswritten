            <p class="mb3">I did actually have a pretty good week other than that, as a proposal of mine for a revamped website and app at work were signed off. I went through the typical cycles of 1) I've got an idea about where I want to take this 2) Oh my god, I'm a terrible designer, someone send help 3) Seriously, I'm going to get fired 4) This might actually work 5) Finished proposal.</p>
            <p>It's a stressful cycle, but confidence in ourselves is something that we all struggle with in the office, and the only way to get better is through practice. Secondly, asking for feedback along the way is sometimes the best way to validate your ideas. If you're unsure about the direction of something, just ask your neighbour. They might not like where you're going, but talking through your ideas will make you more sure about where you want to take things.</p>

                I feel like a bit of a broken record on this topic, but it's no harm given the content is quality. Do you have hobbies? Are you competitive with them? This article is an interesting one, in that it discusses our inability to have a hobby just for the fun of it. When was the last time you went for a run and weren't trying to beat your PB? Can it we not just <em>enjoy</em> things? It's not all about being the best, but taking ourselves away from the desk and trying something new, without expectations.

            <p class="lh-copy f4 mb4">
                I've touched on our obsession to become well known in our industries before, but this article is a very open piece from a well known blogger, about what it's like to be a 'known person'. When you hit publish on something, you're in effect known whether you like it or not, and we should perhaps think about the repercussion that our opinions have on others. Question is, should we stick to our lanes, or engage in conversations about topics that don't necessarily relate to our industry?

            <p class="lh-copy f4 mb4">
                One of my favourite movies, Lost in Translation is a wonderful dreamlike exploration into the lives of those in a fast paced city trying to keep up. Did you know that Scarlett Johansson was 17 in it? Me neither. This article is a great insight into the mind of director Sofia Coppola and her approach to making the movie, including the fact that the script was written with Bill Murray in mind, and if he said no they would not have gone ahead with it. Have a read, then stick the movie on.

                This is a good one. When was the last time you hung out with friends and it didn't and the conversation didn't take a controversial turn? Trump, Brexit, immigration, TV shows, is it possible to us to talk about anything without it becoming an intellectual competition or a debate of our morals? I'm not sure. The NYTimes have taken a critical look at this bizarre situation we find ourselves in, and have unsurprisingly knocked it out of the park. Enjoy.
